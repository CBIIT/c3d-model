Consensus guidelines for use by population cancer registries for staging childhood cancers (the Toronto Childhood Cancer Stage Guidelines) have been developed.
tumor_classification	The classification of a tumor based primarily on histopathological characteristics.
tumor_grade	Numeric value to express the degree of abnormality of cancer cells, a measure of differentiation and aggressiveness.
tumor_stage_clinical_m	Extent of the distant metastasis for the cancer based on evidence obtained from clinical assessment parameters determined prior to treatment.
